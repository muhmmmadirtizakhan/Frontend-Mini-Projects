# 🚀 Mini Projects Collection – HTML | CSS | JavaScript

## 👋 Introduction
This repository contains a collection of **mini front-end projects** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
These projects were initially created as **simple logic-based applications**, and later enhanced with **modern UI/UX designs using advanced AI tools 🤖✨**.

All projects are **live deployed on Netlify 🌐** and maintained on GitHub for learning, practice, and showcasing front-end skills.

## 🤖 AI Tools Used for Design Enhancement
To improve **UI/UX, layout structure, and visual consistency**, multiple AI tools were used during the enhancement phase:

- 🧠 **ChatGPT** – logic refinement, UI ideas, code optimization  
- 🔍 **DeepSeek** – problem solving & alternative implementations  
- ✨ **Google Gemini** – design inspiration & UX improvements  
- 🧑‍💻 **GitHub Copilot** – faster development & clean code suggestions  

> 💡 This demonstrates my ability to **effectively use AI as a development assistant**, not just for coding but also for **design thinking and optimization**.

## 🧠 Why Mini Projects Matter?
Mini projects are the **building blocks 🧱 of real-world applications**.  
Each project in this collection focuses on:

- ⚙️ Core JavaScript logic  
- 🧩 DOM manipulation  
- 🖱️ User interaction handling
